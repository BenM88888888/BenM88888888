- 👋 Hi, I’m @BenTaylor25, a first year Computer Science Student.
- 👀 I’m interested in Software and Game Development.
- 💪 I'm experienced with Python, and a bespoke language called Fuze.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java for my course, C# for an extra-curricular scheme, and relearning C++.
- ⏰ I wish to tackle at least the basics of JS/TS, and C later this year, Rust in 2023, and Go in 2024.
